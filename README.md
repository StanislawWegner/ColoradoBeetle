## General Information
This is a simple app designed to make creating shopping lists easier without unnecessary additional features. 
  The application was developed as part of learning the ASP.Net MVC framework. 
In addition to creating and deleting lists or products, it can copy them between lists, 
mark them as purchased or unavailable in the store. 
  An administrator can create user groups, and within these groups, 
  users can collaborate on shopping lists and edit them together.
